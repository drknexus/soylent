# Soylent_R 1.1: Load USDA Database

This R markdown file runs with the purpose of loading the USDA database, saving each table as USDA.Rda and exporting each table as TableName.json.  Where possible, field names etc are the same as in the USDA data dictionary (contained in the downloadable .zip file).  This is version 1, errors are inevitable, please report them.

Converting these data structures to JSON takes a fair bit of memory (~3.5gb) and failing that may crash miserably.  So, I won't always rebuild to .json.

```r
makeJSON <- FALSE
```


## To Do
* Finish setting keys on the `data.table`s
## Data
The database sources are `http://www.ars.usda.gov/SP2UserFiles/Place/12354500/Data/SR25/dnload/sr25.zip` and `http://www.ars.usda.gov/SP2UserFiles/Place/12354500/Data/SR25/dnload/sr25abbr.zip` unpacked into the directory `./sr25`.  Rather than put strain on github or the USDA, it has been left to the compiling user to get them and put them in the right folder.

Most data most users may want will probably be found already wide in the ABBREV table.  However, the soylent project may require the details of the other tables.

## Packages and constants
* [`repsych`][https://github.com/drknexus/repsych] because drknexus is used to it 
* `data.table`, for speed and keying
* `RJSONIO` for speed and compatablity with `shiny`


```r
suppressMessages({
    library(repsych)
    glibrary(data.table, RJSONIO)
})
location <- "./sr25/"
```

```


## File wise-load

```r
files <- list.files(location)
files <- files[grepl(".txt", files)]
database.name <- gsub(".txt", "", files)

for (f in seq_along(files)) {
    assign(database.name[f], as.data.table(read.csv(paste0(location, files[f]), 
        sep = "^", quote = "~", comment.char = "", header = FALSE)))
    setnames(get(database.name[f]), names(get(database.name[f])), get(paste0(database.name[f], 
        ".names")))
}
setkey(FOOD_DES, NDB_No, FdGrp_Cd)
setkey(FD_GROUP, FdGrp_Cd)
setkey(NUT_DATA, NDB_No, Ref_NDB_No, Nutr_No, Src_Cd, Deriv_Cd)
setkey(NUTR_DEF, Nutr_No)
```


## Save results

```r
save(database.name, list = database.name, file = paste0(location, "USDA.Rda"))
if (makeJSON) {
    for (f in seq_along(database.name)) {
        writeLines(toJSON(get(database.name[f]), pretty = TRUE), con = paste0(location, 
            database.name[f], ".json"))
    }
}
```


## Transform results to wide

```r
foodWithData <- merge(FOOD_DES, NUT_DATA, by = "NDB_No")
longres <- merge(foodWithData, NUTR_DEF, by = "Nutr_No")
longres[NutrDesc == "Energy", `:=`(NutrDesc, Units)]
USDAwide <- as.data.table(dcast(longres, Long_Desc + NDB_No + Refuse ~ NutrDesc + 
    Units, value.var = "Nutr_Val"))
```


## Adding otherwise missing columns

```r
invisible({
    #supress console output for data.table
    USDAwide[, `:=`(Chromium_mcg, NA_real_)]
    USDAwide[, `:=`(Biotin_mcg, NA_real_)]
    USDAwide[, `:=`(Iodine_mcg, NA_real_)]
    USDAwide[, `:=`(Price, NA_real_)]
})
```


## Changing column names to something that won't cause text encoding nightmares

```r
setnames(USDAwide, names(USDAwide), gsub("Âµg", "mcg", names(USDAwide)))
save(USDAwide, file = "USDAwide.rda")
if (makeJSON) {
    writeLines(toJSON(USDAwide, pretty = TRUE), con = paste0(location, "USDAwide.json"))
}
```
