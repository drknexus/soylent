# Soylent_R 1.1

_If you don't know what soylent is, visit [soylent.me](http://soylent.me)_

My exposure to the idea of doing a DIY soylent recipe came from [zda][https://github.com/zda/soylent], cf. the source [food blog](http://www.cookingfor20.com/2013/06/18/hacker-school-soylent-recipe/) for more details. **Also, see the Safety heading**.

Please submit bug reports and if you are interested I welcome co-developers and forks.

## Purpose
* Follow through on idea of setting the development of soylent into a computational/programming framework with source control.  This should eliminate the need for a proliferation of forks for specific needs.
* Allow for flexible/specific needs.
** Gender specific needs, e.g. For example, techbelle has [a fork][https://github.com/techbelle/soylent] that has a 'girlysoylent'.  
** Allergy specific needs
** Regional ingredient/brand availability
** Monetary restrictions
** GMO etc restrictions
** Prep/time # of ingredient restrictions
* Make it safe(r); this involves collecting feedback from users and tracking users over time... for now this can be handled through github's issue tracker
* Create a [`shiny`][http://www.rstudio.com/shiny/] interface to accomplish it all.
* Create an annotated database that suits the need of this project and others.  I'm not familiar with JSON as a database format.  So, at first I will use .csv files to store nutritional data.  I will seek to allow the exporting of this data as JSON via the `rjson` package.  

## Safety

What I am writing almost certainly is not safe.  The source fork also has disclaimers... but this one is more serious.  I'm breaking the recipe down and doing stuff to it.  At any given point it almost certainly isn't particularly safe.

## Build notes
### Pre-requites
* Have a working version of the USDA database.  The attempt to do this is currently included in 'loadUSDADatabase.Rmd' which produces `USDA.Rda` (long format) and `USDAwide.Rda` (wide format).  Zipped JSON entries for each of these will also be made available in ./sr25/ but will be updated infrequently due to the file size.  If building from scratch, the short version is that the database source documents are `http://www.ars.usda.gov/SP2UserFiles/Place/12354500/Data/SR25/dnload/sr25.zip` and `http://www.ars.usda.gov/SP2UserFiles/Place/12354500/Data/SR25/dnload/sr25abbr.zip` unpacked into the directory `./sr25`.

### R Packages
* Required:  [`repsych`][https://github.com/drknexus/repsych]. Not because it is actually required, but because drknexus is accustomed to having that framework available in the background.
* It requires `shiny` in anticipation in anticipation of making use of shiny as an interface.
* `data.table` because it handles big data better than data.frames and makes for prettier code
* `reshape2` helps restructure data from wide to long
* `doBy` is my preferred way to aggregate
* `knitr` lets us go from markdown to R scripts than can be run
* `paralell` is going to allow us to throw multiple cores at the optimization problem
```{r loadPackages,results='hide',echo=FALSE}
library(repsych)
glibrary(shiny,data.table,reshape2,doBy,knitr,paralell)

```
### Load USDA Database in Wide Format
See loadUSDAdatabase.md for annotated code, loadUSDAdatabase for pre-purled code, and USDAwide.Rda for the database that much of the rest of this rests on.
```{r}
purl("loadUSDAdatabase.Rmd",quiet=TRUE)
source("loadUSDAdatabase.R")
```
